    <h1>Understanding the Life Cycle</h1>

    <p>This document outlines the key stages of a generic life cycle, demonstrating progression through various phases.</p>

    <h2>Stage 1: Initiation</h2>
    <p>This is the starting point of the life cycle, where ideas are conceived, requirements are gathered, and initial planning takes place. It's the foundational phase.</p>

    <h2>Stage 2: Development/Growth</h2>
    <p>During this stage, the core elements of the subject undergo creation, development, or significant growth. This often involves building, refining, and expanding.</p>

    <h2>Stage 3: Operation/Maturity</h2>
    <p>This phase represents the active use or peak performance of the subject. It is characterized by stability, utilization, and potentially, optimization.</p>

    <h2>Stage 4: Decline/Transition</h2>
    <p>As the life cycle progresses, this stage signifies a period of decline, reduced activity, or a transition towards a new phase or eventual conclusion.</p>

    <h2>Stage 5: End/Disposal</h2>
    <p>The final stage marks the conclusion of the life cycle, where the subject is retired, disposed of, or reaches its ultimate end state.</p>
